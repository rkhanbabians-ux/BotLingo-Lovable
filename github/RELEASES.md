# Using GitHub Releases for Large Assets

- Create a new release and upload assets (each file must be **≤ 2 GiB**).
- Keep repository size smaller (ideally <1 GiB, strongly recommended <5 GiB).
- Link assets from your docs: e.g., `releases/download/v0.2.3/demo-video.mp4`.

Tip: For files >2 GiB, split them or host externally.
